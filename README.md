# FIUBOOK Webapp

**FIUBOOK** is a university booking system that allows service offerers to publish their services (such as _books_, _classrooms_, _projectors_, etc.) and requestors to book those services. Services bookings can be automatically confirmed or manually confirmed by the service owner, and they can be flagged as returnable (if they are physical objects, such as projectors) or not. It is a role-based system, so services can be configured to be booked by a subset of useres that have certain roles. 

It also provides an Administrator console that enables management of services, bookings, users, and displays system usage metrics.
